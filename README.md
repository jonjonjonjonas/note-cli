2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install prompt_toolkit
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### First Run
On first run, the application will prompt you to configure your note folders. These are the directories where your notes are stored.

- **Ctrl-N** - Create new note in selected folder
- **Ctrl-F** - Create new folder in selected folder
- **Ctrl-D** - Delete selected file (with confirmation)

### Folder Management
- **Ctrl-S** - Manage search folders

### Search
- Type in the search bar to filter notes and folders
- Search works on both folder names and note names
- Search automatically expands folders to show matches

### Other Commands
- **Ctrl-I** - Show comprehensive help
- **Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Q** - Quit the application

## 💡 **Tips**

- Empty folders are shown in the tree view
- Use arrow keys to navigate the folder structure
- Search automatically expands folders to show matches
- After editing a note, the CLI will restart automatically
- Configuration is saved in `notecli_config.json` in the same directory as the script

## 🔧 **Configuration**

The application stores its configuration in `notecli_config.json` in the project root. This file contains:
- List of folders to search for notes
- Your preferred text editor

### Example Configuration
```json
{
  "folders": [
    "~/Documents/notes",
    "~/Desktop/quick-notes"
  ],
  "editor": "code"
}
```

## 🛡️ **Security**

This application includes comprehensive security measures:

### Path Validation
- Prevents directory traversal attacks
- Validates all file and folder paths
- Ensures operations stay within configured directories

### Editor Security
- Whitelist of safe editor commands
- Prevents command injection attacks
- Validates editor before execution

### Input Sanitization
- Validates filenames for dangerous extensions
- Checks for null bytes and path separators
- Ensures safe folder access

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

The application is built using:
- **prompt_toolkit** - Terminal User Interface (TUI) framework
- **pathlib** - Object-oriented filesystem paths
- **OOP Design** - Clean, maintainable code structure
- **State Management** - Proper application state handling

### Key Components
- `NoteCLI` class - Main application logic
